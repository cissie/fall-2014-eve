The project I plan on building in this class is a web interface for the record collection database of the magazine Maximum Rocknroll. The magazine houses over 40,000 punk records making it the largest collection of punk records in the world. I'd like to make a searchable website with a page for every record in the collection. On each page I plan to include:
<ul>
    <li>
    The magazine's review of the record.
    </li>
    <li>
    An image of the record cover with the magazine's green-taped edges.
    </li>
    <li>
    The year that the record was released.
    </li>
    <li>
    The name of the label that released the record.
    </li>
</ul>
